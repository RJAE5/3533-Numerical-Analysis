### AI Disclaimer

At MSU Texas, use of AI is (currently) at the discretion of the professor, and I will adhere to the rules laid out for each class in their respective syllabus. First and foremost, the syllabus for this course (MATH 3533 - Numerical Analysis Fall 2025) explicity forbids the usage of AI in any form.

Subsequently, my usage of AI in this course is non-existent. All code has been implemented manually with understanding coming from class lectures and algorithms from the course reading materials.
